    <h3>The recipe you always wnanted</h3>
    <p>This was always coming from one or two different places</p>
    <p>Not only us can make this whole thing done</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (3 1/2) pound boneless beef chuck roast</li>
      <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 large yellow onion, diced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pat chuck roast dry with a paper towel. Stir together flour, salt, and
        pepper in a small bowl. Sprinkle flour mixture all over the roast,
        pressing lightly to ensure it sticks to the meat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and
        select Saute function. Add oil. Add roast to the hot oil and cook,
        without turning, until browned, about 3 minutes. Turn roast to brown
        each side, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer roast to a plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add onion, garlic, and minced rosemary to the pot; cook, stirring often,
        until onion is translucent, about 6 minutes. Add beef stock, wine, and
        tomato paste and simmer while scraping the browned bits of food off the
        bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Return roast to the pot along
        with bay leaf.
